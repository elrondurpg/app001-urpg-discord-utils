Welcome to the Git repository for APP001: URPG Discord Utils.

Reach out to Elrond ([[PWN](http://forums.petalburgwoods.com/member.php/7050-Elrond)] | [[PXR](http://www.pokemoncrossroads.com/forum/member.php?5531-Elrond)]) to join the project! 

##Setup##

1. Download Git Bash, available [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or your favorite Git client. (The rest of these steps will assume you are using Git Bash, but if you have another preferred Git client, you've probably got the skills to transcribe these steps for your own program.)

2. Run the downloaded .exe file to install Git Bash. Accept all defaults during the install process. 

3. Run the Git Bash program. If you're familiar with a Linux environment, you've probably guessed that Git Bash allows you to navigate around your computer using a classic Bash shell. If you're *not* familiar with Linux or Bash, here is a rundown of some basic stuff you should know. You can try running some of these commands by typing them into the Git Bash console and hitting Enter: 

`pwd` = "Present working directory" - This tells you which folder, or "directory" Git Bash is currently working in. When I run `pwd`, for example, the answer is `/c/Users/Elrond`, so it's like I've opened the Windows explorer and navigated to C:\Users\Elrond. 

`ls` = Lists all the files and directories in your present working directory. For example, when I run `ls`, I see folders like "Documents" and "Pictures".

`cd <directory_name>` = "Change directory" - You've just run `ls` to see which directories you can get to from your current location. So, for example, I could run `cd Documents` to navigate to my "Documents" folder.

`mkdir <directory_name>` = "Make directory" - This command allows you to create a new directory. So if I run `mkdir git`, that will create a new folder called 'git' in my current folder. Now I can see it if I run `ls` or navigate into it by running `cd git`!

4. Decide which folder you'd like to put all of your project files in. I use `/c/Users/Elrond/git`. If you'd like to do the same thing, try running these three commands (fill in your username): 

```
cd /c/Users/<your_username>/
mkdir git
cd git
```

5. Clone this repository. This means you'll copy all the files from GitHub onto your computer into your current folder. Run this command: 

`git clone https://github.com/elrondurpg/app001-urpg-discord-utils.git`

6. Setup is complete! You can now work on the project on your own computer.
